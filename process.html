        <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
        
        <p>Lack of affordable housing in SA.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>By 2014, 23 percent of the urban population in South Africa were 
                living in informal housing settlements or “shacks,” which are generally 
                built poorly out of tin and other materials. Living in informal 
                settlements in South Africa is dangerous and uncomfortable. 
                There is often no sanitation or plumbing, no running water and no electricity. 
                Furthermore, urbanization in the last 10 years has increased the 
                number of South Africans relying on informal accommodations.</li>

                            <li>Definition of an informal dwelling: "a makeshift strucutre not 
                                approved by a local authority and not intended as a permanent dwelling."</li>
